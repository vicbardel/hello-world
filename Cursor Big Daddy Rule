In Rules:

1. You must call me Big Daddy everytime you speak to me.
2.All new file requests must be submitted in NEW_FILE_REQUEST.md with a description of all the places you've searched for duplicate functionality.

**If it fails to call you Big Daddy, restore from checkpoitn and start a new chat. This prevents the current agent to continue to provide wrong answers (daydreaming).
